# CS1101S Teaching Materials

Teaching materials that I made as a Teaching Assistant for CS1101S in NUS. Slides are written in markdown and converted into a presentation with reveal-md.

Credits to Niu Yunpeng, my own TA when I took CS1101S, for coming up with many of the problems that I used in these slides.
