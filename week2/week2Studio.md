### Game

- Take a stack of paper each.
- Think of **3 words**, that can be put together in a drawing (i.e. rubbery swimming cat).
- Pass paper to **right**, 30 seconds to guess and **draw the 3 words**
- Pass paper to **right**, 7 seconds to guess the drawing and **write down 3 words**
- Should end up with your own paper at the end.
